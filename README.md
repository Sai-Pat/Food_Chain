Redefining Trust in the Food Chain with Blockchain and IoT 
Consumers often lack clarity about the origin and production of their food, leading to trust issues in the supply 
chain. Our project leverages blockchain technology to provide complete traceability, ensuring transparent and reliable 
information from farm to table. ensuring full traceability of agricultural products, providing consumers with transparent, 
real-time insights into the origin, quality, and journey of their food while fostering trust and accountability across the 
supply chain. 

*  Solution :  
The system allows farmers, suppliers, and companies to upload GPS-tagged profiles and certifications while 
providing detailed insights into food origin, quality, and journey. This data is stored on an immutable blockchain ledger 
and accessed via QR codes on packaging, enabling consumers to instantly view essential information about their food.  
We have enhanced the existing system with the following features:   
1. Quality Checks with Enhanced Transparency: - Details about crop production, including methods used and pesticides applied, are securely stored on the blockchain.   - Both companies and farmers are required to upload their Organic Certifications to ensure authenticity and quality 
compliance.   
2. Real-Time Food Traceability: - Leveraging IoT and blockchain technology, we provide real-time traceability of food products, ensuring complete 
visibility at every stage of the supply chain.   
3. Specialized System for Locally Sourced Food: - Once food reaches the sabji mandi (vegetable market) from farmers and intermediaries, a common QR code is 
generated by mandi vendors.   - This QR code can be used by all vegetable vendors, enabling consumers to scan and verify the authenticity and 
traceability of locally sourced vegetables. 

*  Impact & Outcomes : 
The system ensures transparency and trust by enabling consumers to trace food origin, quality, and journey via 
QR codes. IoT monitoring and compliance with certifications enhance food safety and quality standards. It also supports 
local ecosystems by empowering farmers and vendors with fair and efficient markets.. Retailers will benefit from 
improved product credibility and consumer trust, boosting sales and brand reputation.
